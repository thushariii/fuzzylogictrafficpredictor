# fuzzylogictrafficpredictor
ðŸ’¡An algorithm to detect the traffic flow on roads based on three parameters .No. of lanes,  Quality of Road &  Visibility  

The Traffic on the basis of no. of lanes, road surface and visibility is found and this is provided as input to neural network to control the traffic. The continuity of the traffic flow for different values of variables is calculated.
